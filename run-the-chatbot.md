# Run the chatbot

&#x20;**Run the chatbot**

To run the chatbot, we have two main files; **train\_chatbot.py** and **chatapp.py**.

First, we train the model using the command in the terminal:

```python
# Python Code
python train_chatbot.py
```

If we donâ€™t see any error during training, we have successfully created the model. Then to run the app, we run the second file.

```python
# Python Code
python chatgui.py
```

The program will open up a GUI window within a few seconds. With the GUI you can easily chat with the bot.
