#### About the Python Project – Chatbot

In this Python project with source code, we are going to build a chatbot using deep learning techniques. The chatbot will be trained on the dataset which contains categories (intents), pattern and responses. We use a special recurrent neural network (LSTM) to classify which category the user’s message belongs to and then we will give a random response from the list of responses.

Let’s create a retrieval based chatbot using NLTK, Keras, Python, etc.



#### Download Chatbot Code & Dataset

The dataset we will be using is ‘intents.json’. This is a JSON file that contains the patterns we need to find and the responses we want to return to the user.

Please download python chatbot code & dataset from the following link: [**Python Chatbot Code & Dataset**](https://github.com/anilkumarKanasani/chatbot)****



#### Prerequisites

The project requires you to have good knowledge of Python, Keras, and [_**Natural language processing (NLTK)**_](https://www.nltk.org/). Along with them, we will use some helping modules which you can download using the python-pip command.

```python
# Python Code
pip install tensorflow, keras, pickle, nltk
```
