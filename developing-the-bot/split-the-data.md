# Split the data

**3. Create training and testing data**

Now, we will create the training data in which we will provide the input and the output. Our input will be the pattern and output will be the class our input pattern belongs to. But the computer doesnâ€™t understand text so we will convert text into numbers.

```python
// Some code
# create our training data
training = []
# create an empty array for our output
output_empty = [0] * len(classes)
# training set, bag of words for each sentence
for doc in documents:
    # initialize our bag of words
    bag = []
    # list of tokenized words for the pattern
    pattern_words = doc[0]
    # lemmatize each word - create base word, in attempt to represent related words
    pattern_words = [lemmatizer.lemmatize(word.lower()) for word in pattern_words]
    # create our bag of words array with 1, if word match found in current pattern
    for w in words:
        bag.append(1) if w in pattern_words else bag.append(0)

    # output is a '0' for each tag and '1' for current tag (for each pattern)
    output_row = list(output_empty)
    output_row[classes.index(doc[1])] = 1

    training.append([bag, output_row])
# shuffle our features and turn into np.array
random.shuffle(training)
training = np.array(training)
# create train and test lists. X - patterns, Y - intents
train_x = list(training[:,0])
train_y = list(training[:,1])
print("Training data created")
```
